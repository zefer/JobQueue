This is a simple way to run a batch of background tasks, in JavaScript. The concept is basically:

1. Create an instance of the JobQueue class
2. Create lots of instances of the Job class, and add them to the JobQueue
3. Run the JobQueue

Could be used to:
- preload images, AJAX, or other http requests
- run a sequence of AJAX requests (e.g. for gathering lots of data)
